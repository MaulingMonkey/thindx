//! D3DX Functions (Direct3D 9)
//!
//! *Required Features: `d3dx9`*<br>
//! **Note:** D3DX is deprecated as of Windows 8, and is banned on the Windows Store!<br>
//!
//! Utility functions that you should probably avoid in favor of safer Rust crates.
//! It's quite likely that full coverage may never be implemented.
//! However, I encourage pull requests if D3DX functions are desired.
//!
